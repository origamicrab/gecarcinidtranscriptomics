The transition from marine to terrestrial habitats was one of the most significant evolutionary events in the history of life on Earth. 
Little has been done to characterize the genes that enabled these physiologically challenging transitions. 
Herein, we explore the genetic basis for these transitions in terrestrial crabs, which have repeatedly and independently colonized land.

In this repo, you will find all code that was used to analyze the raw data (uploaded to NCBI, BioProject: TBD) and generate the tables and figures for our publication.

If you attempt to use this code for your own project and something breaks, please message the corresponding author on this paper for assistance.
